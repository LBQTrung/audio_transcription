 Let's check out what 1.65 million gets you here in Vancouver.  Welcome to the home tour at 4248 Windsor Street in the Kensington Cedar Cottage  area for this brand new construction half-duplex that hit the market yesterday at 1.65 million.  Super open and airy living space with the double doors out to the huge deck for that indoor outdoor  living. A lot of the time you see duplexes split right down the middle. This one is actually split  more of a front and back duplex so you can have long spanning rooms and balconies just like this one.  Since this is a brand new home it does come with the two five and ten year warranties that  homes come with here in British Columbia. We also have a backyard which we'll see in a moment and  below us is the single car garage. Everything's been done with high end appliances and finishes,  hardwood floor, the marble countertop and backsplash. Even the toilets are the fancy robot kind as you'll see.  Overall terrific entertaining space on this main floor and on the third floor are where the three  bedrooms are. First bedroom here we've got space for a queen bed and off of it is the balcony.  There's actually a balcony off every single room in this home and back here down to the left you  can see your backyard. I wish I had a backyard. Me too. Do you want to buy this place? Yeah.  And into the second bedroom off the balcony this is a shared balcony between these two bedrooms.  Really spacious room here and also has a walk-in closet on the right back into the hallway going  into the primary bedroom with the en suite and another walk-in closet of course.  Duplexes are you know a really great option for a growing family or someone who just wants  more space maybe wants a single car garage or a backyard and this one this one's a great option.
