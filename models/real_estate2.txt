Let’s take a look at what $320,000 can get you in the suburbs of Phoenix, Arizona! Welcome to the tour of this budget-friendly 2-bedroom, 1.5-bath condo located at 2101 East Monroe Street. This property just came onto the market and, although it’s a more affordable option, it offers a comfortable and functional living space perfect for first-time buyers or small families.

When you step inside, you’re welcomed by a cozy living room with ample natural light. The layout is straightforward, with the living, dining, and kitchen areas combined into an open floor plan. While it doesn’t have the luxurious finishes of a high-end property, the kitchen is functional with standard appliances and plenty of counter space. There’s a small patio just off the living area, providing a bit of outdoor space that’s perfect for a morning coffee or small container garden.

One thing to note is that this building is a bit older, so the interior may feel dated in places. The carpeting in the main areas shows some wear, and the bathrooms could benefit from updated fixtures. However, these are small compromises that a handy buyer could address over time to really make this space feel like home.

Upstairs, you’ll find two bedrooms that are modest in size, each fitting a full or queen bed comfortably. The main bathroom is shared between the bedrooms, with a tub-shower combination and standard finishes.

Another consideration with this property is that it comes with a single assigned parking spot, and guest parking can be a bit limited. There’s no garage or covered parking, so you’ll need to plan for outdoor parking in the Arizona sun. Additionally, the community amenities are minimal, with just a small shared pool and laundry facility for residents.

Overall, this condo represents a functional and budget-friendly option in the Phoenix area, with room for some creative updates. It’s a solid choice for someone looking to enter the real estate market without stretching their budget too thin.
