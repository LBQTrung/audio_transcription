 How to Talk About Travel I used to travel a lot for work. In my experience, I found that the bus is the cheapest form of travel. In contrast, the plane is the most expensive form of travel. Going on foot or by bicycle is probably the safest, but it takes much longer. As for the most fun, I'd have to say that motorbikes are the best. I remember a trip to Iceland five years ago. It was really exciting. I traveled with my college friend. We split the cost of everything, so it turned out to be quite cheap. If you share a room with someone, it can be less expensive. We rented a car and traveled around the island. The best parts of the trip were finding cool places to set up our tents and camp for the night. It was very relaxing to fall asleep under the Icelandic stars. The worst parts of the trip were not having a place to shower for more than five days. I believe that we smelled terrible. In the future, I would like to go on a trip across Canada. I think that the best form of transportation in Canada is car.
